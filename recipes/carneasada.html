            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk to combine the olive oil, soy sauce, lime juice, vinegar, sugar, black pepper, and cumin in a large, non-reactive bowl or baking dish. Stir in the minced garlic, jalapeño, and cilantro.

                    Place the steak in the marinade and turn over a couple of times to coat thoroughly.
                    
                    Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 to 4 hours or overnight.</li>
                <li>Preheat your grill for high direct heat, with part of the grill reserved with fewer coals (or gas flame) for low, indirect heat. You'll know the grill is hot enough when you can hold your hand above the grill grates for no more than one second.</li>
                <li>Remove the steak from the marinade. Lightly brush off most of the bits of cilantro and garlic (do not brush off the oil).

                    Place on the hot side of the grill. Grill the steak for a few minutes only, until well seared on one side (the browning and the searing makes for great flavor), then turn the steak over and sear on the other side.</li>
                <li>Once both sides are well seared, move the steak to the cool side of the grill, with any thicker end of the steak nearer to the hot side of the grill.

                    Test with a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the steak, or use your fingers (see The Finger Test to Check the Doneness of Meat). Pull the meat off the grill at 115°F to 120°F for rare, 125°F medium rare, 140°F for medium. The meat will continue to cook in its residual heat.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
